#~ Logging some thoughts about this project

So, first off, I keep thinking of extremely grandiose ideas for this project.
Like, storing the database of all nodes in a bitcoin-esqe blockchain that is maintained by the nodes themselves.
This is crazy, I need to KISS this project up and hopefully writing this entry out will help this a little.

### What does this project need to do?
- Run a daemon on each node.
- Ping everything node on a schedule, say everything 10mins or something.
- Store the result of this ping in a database of some kind.

### What OS's will this daemon have to run on?
Arch(Can Package), Debian(Must learn how to package .deb), Windows(fuck my life, .msi??)

### Cool things that could happen in this project?
- Add a node and it's information is propagated to all the nodes in the existing network
- Bootstrap a node's "node list" from an existing node in the network
- Distribute the "connectivity history" database across the nodes, ala bitcoin blockchain
- Store metadata about each nodes OS state
    - Last system update
    - Uptime
- Have some sort of automated deploy based on repository tags, maybe?
    - I dunno, this seems dangerous, but convenient

### Ok, so none of the above are KISS! Where do I start?
I think I should start with creating the daemon and then working on the distribution
- ala
    - Arch PKGBUILD
    - Debian .deb | However that works...
    - Windows | If I even need to worry about windows
If I do this then once the network is up and running and monitoring itself then I can iterate faster.

I think there may be some notes about this in my personal journal as well.
Should take a look and bring whatever is still relevant into here.

I also just came to the realization that the cmd* verbs package structure that I experimented with here is exactly what I needed for journal v1.
Because of this realization this project may be placed on the back burner while I actually go and finish journal v1!
